Didn't like exsisting Teams Room Systems deployment methods from vendors, so I built this project to configure a Windows 10 system to act as the TRS tablet that sits in conference rooms. This is my first GITHUB posting, feel free to borrow it for your needs (Mostly here to learn)

Initial file upload, working on building the rest of it (so easy the roasting :D )
